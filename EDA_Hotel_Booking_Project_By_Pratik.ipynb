        "Which type of hotel is most preferred by guests? How does lead time for booking vary across different arrival years, and what are the associated cancellation trends? Which country has the highest number of guests? What is the distribution of preferred meal types among hotel guests? What is the relationship between the average daily rate (ADR) and the total number of people? Which year recorded the highest number of bookings? Which distribution channel contributes most to ADR, thus increasing income? How does ADR vary across different months? Which distribution channel has the highest cancellation rate? Which distribution channel has the highest count of repeat guests? What is the distribution of market segments and distribution channels in hotel bookings? How are guests with babies distributed across different hotel types, and what are their booking cancellation rates? What is the distribution of hotel arrivals by year and month? The EDA process will begin with data cleaning to address any missing or erroneous data. Following this, the data will be explored using a variety of visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to identify patterns and relationships."

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."
